# You can do a few things with environment variables:
# 1) Set to STAGE=1 to use stage server (when testing)
# When ready to use a real certificate, run the generation command manually with --force (or
# override this to blank on the command line).
# 2) When using the dns-01 challenge (--dns), you can pass in your credentials here. For example,
# DNS Made Easy looks for the ME_Key and ME_Secret environment variables.
#
# By default, this is set to use the Let's Encrypt staging server. This lets you ensure that your
# provisioning will work without using up your Let's Encrypt rate limit.

# REQUIRED TO ISSUE CERTIFICATE: The primary domain for which to issue a certificate. If you need
# certificates for multiple primary domains, include this Ansible role multiple times with different
# arguments. However, in general, it's usually fine to just generate one certificate for all domains
# that point to the same site. Unless you know that you have users whose browsers do not support
# Server Name Indication (SNI), this will work fine.
#
# If you leave this blank, the role will not generate a certificate. You will have to do so in your
# main playbook. That is not normally necessary, though, because you can provide a primary domain
# and then use the acme_sh_issue_suffix variable to provide the rest of the command. You would do
# this if you wanted to use different challenges for each domain. See the "Multiple domains, SAN
# mode, Hybrid mode" section at https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-issue-a-cert

# Arguments to include before the domain arguments when issuing a certificate. The typical use for

# REQUIRED TO ISSUE CERTIFICATE: Specify additional arguments to issue the certificate. This is
# normally the challenge type: for example, -w, --dns, etc. See

# This gets added after the domain arguments. See the comments above acme_sh_primary_domain for

# You do not necessarily need to set all of these. See the acme.sh homepage for Apache and nginx
